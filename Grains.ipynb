    "This tutorial will show how to use the Feed Grains open data source, provided by the USDA Economic Research Service to learn about grain production and historical effects. This tutorial will also explore grain prices in relation to production levels and determine whether there is evidence of some direct correlation, as people would expect based on supply and demand expectations. \n",

    "Before we start the tutorial though, let's just give a simple introduction to the different grain types we'll be talking about!\n",

    "Barley: Member of the grass family, a major cereal grain. First cultivated in Eurasia around 10,000 years ago. Versatile grain that can be grown in many climates globally. Nutlike flavor and chewy. Grown for human consumption, unlike oats, it's not usually grown for animal feed, but for beer. \n",

    "![hay](http://b86170182c11f5e1da3c-7c0671222953158607ea93d5febd68b4.r44.cf1.rackcdn.com/710/assets/responsive/250000/250860/haybales.jpg)\n",
    "Hay: Grass, legumes, or other assorted plants that have been cut, dried, and stored. Used as animal fodder for grazing animals like cows, horses, goats, sheep. Generally not used for human consumption, but some crazy people may eat it). One of, if not the most used feed for livestock. Easy to grow since basically anything can turn into hay. \n",
    "\n",
    "![corn](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/uploads/236/64694/CORN.jpg)\n",
    "Corn: Also known as maize, a large grain first domesticated in southern Mexico around 10,000 years ago. It is a very popular grain, one of the most widely grown foods in the world. People eat it, but also use it for a variety of other stuff like fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "![oats](http://horsehealthyoats.com/images/template/oat-pile.png)\n",
    "Oats: Also known as the common oat, a cereal grain that is grown for its seed. Another popular grain that is widely grown. Although suitable for human consumption, in the form of oatmeal and rolled oats, typically it is grown for livestock feed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![sorghum](http://dartcor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sorghum_grain_01_0.jpg)\n",
    "Sorghum: A genus of flower plants, the majority of people have no idea what it is (I never heard of it until making this tutorial). Versatile crop that can be grown as a grain or sweet crop, supposedl one of the top 5 cereal crops in the world (probably not in the US though).\n",

    "Personally, I would think that the beginning stock of grains each year would be increasing, or at least have an increasing trend, due to improvements in agricultural techniques. However, it is clear based on the graphs that something happened between 1986 and 1988. One event must have led to a massive surplus in 1986, while another event must have led to a huge (deficit?) in 1988. Through a quick search on \"corn supply 1986\" and \"corn supply 1987\", I managed to find 2 articles that explain the phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "http://agfax.com/2016/11/29/grain-market-reminded-of-1986-king-daddy-year-of-corn-stocks-dtn/  \n",
    "The article in the link above describes how there were \"four consecutive years of good crop weather\" which led to not only the US, but the entire world to have excess grain supplies. Only about 66% of corn stock was used, explaining the massive surplus in the time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-13/business/fi-5672_1_food-prices  \n",
    "This article compares the staggering grain production in 1988 compared to 1987. There seems to have been a severe drought that would kill off an estimated 30%-45% of projected harvest. As a result, the surplus that built up the past years must have been depleted in an instant, over the following years of bad weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, it seems that weather has a much greater effect on grain supply than agricultural techniques. However, this correlation can't be concluded without looking at weather data and trying to find a relation between the two datasets. We won't be looking at that today since this is a tutorial to get started in looking at grain data. Instead, we will explore more subsets of data in *FeedGrains.csv*, specifically prices!"

    "Simply looking at the data, there appears to be no relation between stock and prices whatsoever. The most clear indicators are how there's a spike in grain stock around 1987, but there is no defined change in prices during that time period. Prices also spiked around 2012, but there appears to have been no change in average grain stock during that time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through some research, it seems that since around 2010, there has been severe weather conditions such as droughts in the US causing a deficit in the supply (although it seems to look consistent based on the data). Supposedly this is the reason for a raise in price, despite the fact that the data on our grain supply seems to differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting conclusion seems to imply that regardless of the weather and grain supply, it will not have a severe impact on the price of grain, at least in the short term. Although this seems trivial, this does impact virtually everyone. Whether there is another reason that prices are high despite our consistent supply, or demand has simply increased beyond past years, resulting in a higher necessary grain supply, numbers tell more truth than a news article.\n",

I initially expected there to be data for other countries as well so a linear regression line would be useful in determining the global trend of price and supply and determine if there is a relation be comparing the regression lines, but the only data in the dataset is for the US.

    "## Summary and References\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has looked at the changes in grain supply, as well as grain prices over the time period of 1975 to 2016. Through graphical evidence, there does not seem to be any evidence of a correlation between grain price and supply, no matter how much surplus or deficit there is. There may be a correlation with the economy or weather between the two datasets, but that was not explored in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, there are many things that data science can accomplish in any field. New patterns or unexpected trends may be found that were unseen before. With these patterns and unexpected trends, further research and data application can be applied to determine correlations between data. Although correlation does not imply causation, new discoveries may be found that initiate new ideas, especially considering the sheer amount of data, even for something (seemingly simple) like grains.\n",
