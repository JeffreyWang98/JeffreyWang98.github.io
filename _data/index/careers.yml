    detail: I worked on Android in Alarm.com's mobile division, writing Java and xml code. Specifically, I worked with the live video portion of their application.
            There were 3 projects I worked on this summer, 2 of which were part of a large-scale change in the app's structure in the near future.
            First, I worked on the video card, replacing an outdated radio button selector with a ViewPager to allow users to swipe between live video feeds.
            The purpose of this project was to modernize the UI as well as improve user operation time.
            Since the average user of the app has 2 cameras, the previous design required 3 taps, while this new design only requires 1 swipe, cutting user operation time by 66%
            I also worked on modernizing the old video control buttons. The old buttons were static, below the video feed, and shared between the video feeds.
            The new button style I created is similar to most modern UIs, half transparent buttons overlaying the video and fade out with a tap or 3 second timeout.
            
            The second project I worked on involved Picture-in-Picture, a feature to be released in Android O.
            This involved working with limited to no documentation on
            
            The last project I worked on was to replace the feature screen, previously a single camera feed view, with a RecyclerView to dynamically load as many video feeds as will fit on the screen.
            This is part of a larger-scale project to add multi-view feeds

    detail: Improved the particle filter in an offline user-tracking app to increase accuracy to within 1 meter.
            Redesigned the app to turn it into a consumer ready product currently known as Neon Squad Tracker
            Created a Google Maps based prototype of the base user-tracking app to demonstrate potential future development paths
            Began development on a new application in Cesium JS intended to replace the current PC application, which is used to create 3D building floor plans and track user locations in 3D.
            It would allow users to use the application on any platform such as phones and tablets versus the current PC only application.
            Maintenence is also significantly easier compared to having separate applications for each platform since only 1 bug fix is necessary in contrast to 3, one for each platform.

    detail: Wrote a particle filter to locate users connected in an offline environment. Users were located through ultra-wide band bluetooth and inertia sensors to determine inertial x y movement and distance to each other
            Built an Android app using the particle filter to track users and display them on a radar with relative ranges to each other
            Performed extensive tests on the company's tracking based products to expose user-facing bugs and usability enhancements
            Collected extensive indoor location data using the company's mapping application at the University of Maryland to create a map as proof-of-concept for a publically maintained data set for future large-scale testing
